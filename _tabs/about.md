Welcome! I’m Hengshuo Li, and this blog is dedicated to sharing my passion for **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **data science**, and **applied mathematics**.

My goal is to make complex topics accessible and to explore both the theory and practical applications that drive modern technology. Here you’ll find:

- **Machine Learning & AI:** Deep dives into algorithms, frameworks, and real-world use cases.
- **Data Science:** Practical guides, tips on statistical analysis, data visualization, and working with data at scale.
- **Applied Mathematics:** Mathematical insights and techniques that underpin AI and data-driven discovery.

Whether you’re a researcher, student, or enthusiast, I hope you’ll find content here that informs and inspires. I encourage questions, discussion, and collaboration—feel free to reach out or leave a comment on any post!

Thanks for visiting!
